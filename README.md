# mci_lab_stm32f303
A repository for the lab manuals of MCI for the STM32F303 Discovery kit. Each folder contains a README describing the lab and required components, and each subfolder contains the files to be modified in the Templates project (the base on which your projects should be made on Keil) uploaded here to complete the tasks.
