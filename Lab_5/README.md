This is the folder for Lab 5, where we control an SG90 Servo motor using our board. Task 1 moves the servo arm from 0 to 180 degrees and back -- though you will have to modify max/min duty cycles based on your motor in line 222 -- while Task 2 adds a USER button to control rotation. Task 3 adds an ultrasonic sensor to set the servo at 45 degrees for 0-15cm, 90 degrees for 15-30cm, 180 degrees for 30-45cm, and 0 degrees otherwise.
