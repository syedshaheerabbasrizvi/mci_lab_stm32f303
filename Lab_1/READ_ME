Lab 1 is an introduction to Keil and the STM32F303VCT6 Discovery Kit. In the original lab manual, Tasks 1 and 2 are simply installations for the TivaC, so the equivalent for our board would be following the guide I wrote (and might upload here). Task 3 is to toggle LEDs with a delay set by a student ID; for this, take the GPIO_Toggle example project and just change the delay. Task 4 is to demonstrate the functionality of the USER button, which is done by the GPIO_EXTI example project, no changes required. Task 5 (the only one uploaded here) is to use the example Fade code to run on Energia; instead, we made a new task to connect LEDs to PWM outputs and observe different brightnesses. For that, the changed files are present in this folder.
